## Introduction

**XianLai - Admax** is an open-source and lightweight re-development framework of administration system, which is implemented based on Vue3+ElementPlus, Spring Boot and other mainstream frameworks and components. The purpose of the framework is to reduce the burden of enterprise development teams and individual developers, and to avoid the futility of "repeatedly building wheels" when developing administration systems for different systems by realizing the general basic functions of administration system (such as user management, etc.) and supporting re-development. It adopts MIT open-source protocol, and welcomes the vast number of enterprise development teams and individual developers to use it for free!
